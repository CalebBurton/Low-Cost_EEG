# SUN EEG_Design_Files
Modified repo for Ganglion hardware files

All design files made with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) PCB design software.

Tested with Arduino IDE v1.8.5
Utilizes Simblee library v1.1.4 from [https://www.simblee.com/package_simblee166_index.json](https://www.simblee.com/package_simblee166_index.json)
Programmed using an FTDI cable. FTDI drivers are not yet supported on macOS versions 10.11.0 and above, so programming was done in a Windows 10 VM.
