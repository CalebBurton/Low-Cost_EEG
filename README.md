# Low-Cost EEG
Repo for storing files related to the Low-Cost EEG project at Stellenbosch University during the 2018 Global Health Technologies exchange with Northwestern University.

Hardware is modified from the [OpenBCI Ganglion](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Ganglion_Hardware_Design_Files), firmware is copied directly from the [Ganglion library](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_Ganglion_Library) with no modification.

All design files made with [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/) EDA software.

Tested with Arduino IDE v1.8.5

Utilizes Simblee library v1.1.4 from [https://www.simblee.com/package_simblee166_index.json](https://www.simblee.com/package_simblee166_index.json)

Programmed using an FTDI cable. FTDI drivers are not yet supported on macOS versions 10.11.0 and above, so programming was done in a Windows 10 virtual machine.
